# PracticingUnderscoreJS

Here is my attempt at recreating most of the Underscorejs.org functions. 
I tried my best to code them in a clear and easy-to-read manner. 
I also added extra examples for some of the functions, in order to show more specific use cases. 


Inspired by the Underscore.js library:
Underscore.js 1.7.0
